# Speckle Server

This is the Speckle Server (Community Extension), which coordinates communications between the various bits of the Speckle ecosystem. 

The Community Extension Speckle were born when the Speckle Systems crew discontinued Speckle v1, and started development a v2. At the moment,
[Arup Group](https://www.arup.com/) is maintaining the Community Extension produts, and developing them further to meet the needs of our project
teams and clients. Our work remains open source, and we hope that will be valuable to anyone else working with Speckle v1.

## API

[API docs are here](https://speckleworks.github.io/SpeckleSpecs/) - they are a good overview of what you can do.

## Installation

The Speckle Server is a nodejs (`v.8+`, `latest stable` preffered) app.

- Configuration: create a `.env` using `.env-base` as a template, and fill in the required information.
- Run `npm install` and thereafter `npm run`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: if these instructions seem confusing and you want to use speckle in production, please consult someone with more experience! Incorrect configuration can have **security and reliability implications**. 

>¬†Community supported instructions by on how to set up a development server (thanks @arendvw!) can be found in [this discourse thread](https://discourse.speckle.works/t/speckle-server-debian-9-installation-notes-for-development-machines/344). Feel free to contribute your own experiences there, or ask questions.

To install a front-end plugin, such as the [admin ui](https://github.com/arup-group/SpeckleAdmin), clone the respective repo in the `plugins` folder of the server.
