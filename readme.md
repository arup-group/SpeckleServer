- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleServer.git`
- Configuration: create a `.env` using `.env-base` as a template, and fill in the required information.
- Run `npm install` and thereafter `npm run`.


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: if these instructions seem confusing and you want to use speckle in production, please consult someone with more experience! Incorrect configuration can have **security and reliability implications**. 

>¬†Community supported instructions by on how to set up a development server (thanks @arendvw!) can be found in [this discourse thread](https://discourse.speckle.works/t/speckle-server-debian-9-installation-notes-for-development-machines/344). Feel free to contribute your own experiences there, or ask questions.

#### üç∞ If you just want to try out speckle, at your own risk, you can use `https://hestia.speckle.works/api`.

**Note**: hestia is hosted on Digital Ocean. If you want to signup to digital ocean and support the running costs of speckle, use [the following affiliate link](https://m.do.co/c/947a2b5d7dc1) to get $100 in credit. 

To install a front-end plugin, such as the [admin ui](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleAdmin), clone the respective repo in the `plugins` folder of the server.

#### Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

**Note**: this doesn't include any front-end plugins, so you'll need to interact with a Heroku-hosted server via another front-end, such as https://app.speckle.systems.
